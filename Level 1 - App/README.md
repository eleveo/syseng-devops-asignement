# Web Application

We have a customer which is very curious about monitoring how many visitors he has on his page. Therefore, write a simple web app in a language of your choice (python3 preferred) which will:

- display a visit counter for a web page when you load it
- Application should be containerized
- We should be able to start it with a simple `docker run ... `command (you can also use other container runtimes).

## OPTIONAL:
- Visit count is persisant with application restart
