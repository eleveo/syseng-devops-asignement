# Microservice

Each devops engineer knows, that easy maintenance is the best feature of any application. Therefore create a **Kubernetes manifest**, which will deploy the app which you created in the previous Level.

- The app should be accessible from remote web browser.
- We should be able to start it with a simple  `kubectl apply ...` command
- If Level 1 was skipped, use a [microbot](https://hub.docker.com/r/dontrebootme/microbot/) for this level instead.

## OPTIONAL:
- Pack the application into HELM

# Operation
< your brief documentation on how to use the application >

# Known Issues
< fill in your implementation limitations >
