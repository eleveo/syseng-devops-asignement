# Cloud Deployment

If you got here, you are at the end. We need you to just deploy the application into the cloud so you don't have to maintain the underlying infrastructure.

- Select your favourite cloud platform from AWS, GCP or MS Azure
- Create a terraform module or file that will spins up a virtual machine
- During the VM initialization phase, run the ansible playbook from Level 3 to deploy your app
- If Level 3 was skipped, install and enable nginx webserver
- We should be able to start everything with a simple `terraform apply` command

## OPTIONAL:
- Terraform state file is stored in the cloud
